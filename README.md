Background

Web-scraping and data analysis project. 
I’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Selenium and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

Collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating my insights.

This project consists of two technical products:
    Part 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
    Part 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
